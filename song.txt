Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look they are shining
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
...
When I see your face 
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl youre amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah
